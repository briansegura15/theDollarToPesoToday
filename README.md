## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs

IDE used was VScode, images used from Unsplash, fonts are from Google Fonts. Built out the HTML followed by styling with vanilla CSS then implemented functionality with vanilla JS.

## Optimizations

Would enjoy going back and implementing the option to not only acquire the transfer rates from USD -> COP but vice versa as well as making the app fully responsive and mobile friendly.

## Lessons Learned:

Further experience gained on working with APIs. Enjoyed diving into css transitions in order to blend background images.
